Basic python code to compare lists
Copy and paste Instagram following and followers to compare people you follow who don't follow you back
"Â·" in follower list copies over to indicate people who you don't follow back, but is removed in list compilation process
There is a module for Python that allows a bot to read in your Instagram following and followers, but usage is flagged as bot activity if done incorrectly, so safest to copy and paste in strings.
